# Student Success Prediction

## Problem Description
This project aims to help teachers predict whether a student will pass or fail, optimizing attention and resource allocation for student support. The prediction model will be developed using a random forest algorithm.

## Cloud or Local Deployment
The project will be deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. The Jupyter notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model development will be run on this instance. The backend database for experiment tracking will be a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS.

## Experiment Tracking
Experiment tracking will be managed using MLflow. The MLflow tracking server will be hosted on the same EC2 instance, with the backend database being a PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS.

## Workflow Orchestration
Mage will be used for workflow orchestration. The `test.py` and `predict.py` scripts will be automated using Mage. There will be two triggers:
- **Training Trigger**: Runs every day at 6 PM.
- **Predict Trigger**: Triggered through an API.

## Model Deployment
The model will be deployed on the AWS EC2 instance. The deployment process will include setting up the necessary environment and dependencies.

## Monitoring
Model and data drift will be monitored using a Grafana dashboard. Evidently reports will be used to produce drift metrics.

## Reproducibility
To ensure reproducibility, the following steps should be followed:
1. Set up an AWS account.
2. Run the Docker Compose file to start up Mage and Grafana.
3. Follow the instructions in the `setup.md` file for detailed setup and configuration.

## Action Plan
1. **Data Source**: Obtain student success prediction data from Kaggle. DONE 
2. **Problem Statement**: Develop scripts to predict student success using a random forest model. DONE
3. **EDA**: Perform EDA using a Jupyter notebook. DONE
4. **Experiment Tracking**: Use MLflow for tracking experiments. DONE
5. **Workflow Orchestration**: Automate scripts using Mage. 
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor model and data drift using Grafana.
7. **Reproducibility**: Ensure reproducibility with detailed setup instructions.
